      Greetings! I'm Thomas, an aspiring web developer who enjoys reading and
      creative writing in his spare time. I am exploring web development in
      college to discern whether the field is a potential career interest for me
      - so far, I have really enjoyed how the discipline allows one to easily
      visualize their work and express an outlet for artistic creativity. Thank
      you for taking the time to learn about me and my interests!
    </p>
