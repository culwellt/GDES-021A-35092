    <h2>Places I have visited</h2>
    <p>
      Here are some images from when I traveled the world. These were my top
      three favorite places. The food was amazing! <br />

    <h2>Favorite Animals</h2>
    <p>
      I definitely consider myself a cat person. I love dogs too, but I get
      along better with cats. Here are 2 images of my favorite animals.

    <h2>Favorite Movie</h2>
    <p>
      Here is a picture of my favorite movie. If you click on it, it will take
